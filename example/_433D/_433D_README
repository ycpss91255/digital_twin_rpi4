REQUIRES

A radio transmitter and/or radio receiver connected to the Pi GPIO.

313MHz and 434MHz are commonly used frequencies for key fobs.

This software assumes the codes to be received and transmitted use
Manchester encoding.

TO BUILD

gcc -Wall -pthread -o _433D test_433D.c _433D.c -lpigpiod_if2

TO RUN

sudo pigpiod # If the daemon is not already running

then

./_433D -r10 # Print fob keycodes received on GPIO 10.

or

./_433D -t5 8246184 # Transmit code on GPIO 5.

or

./_433D -r10 -t5 8246184 # Transmit code on GPIO 5 then listen for codes

or

./_433D -? # for help

By default _433D returns two values for each read code, being the code and the number of bits. e.g.

8246180 24

If you plan to transmit the code it is useful to know the intercode gap
as well as the short and long pulse length.  To see this information add
the -f option to the command line, e.g. ./_433D -r10 -f might give

8246180 24 9035 298 891

where 9035 is the gap, 298 is the short pulse (t0) and 891 is the long
pulse (t1).
